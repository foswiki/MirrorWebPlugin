This example demonstrates use of the MirrorWebPlugin to mirror a tracking
web that uses the !BugsContrib. The tracking web contains jobs belonging
to several different customers. These jobs are mirrored into a shared mirror
web where the customers can only see the topics intended for
them.

The topics to be mirrored all have "JobForm" attached to them,
and the customer is identified by a "Customer" field in that form.

Each customer has a group topic, the name of which is derived from
the Customer field using MAKEGROUP. Members of this group are granted
view access using ALLOWTOPICVIEW. The value
of the 'Manager' field in the group topic is retrieved by FORMFIELD and
used as the new value for the 'Customer' field in the mirror topic.

There is also a 'Contact' field in the source topic that contains the
wikiname of someone in the company who interfaces to that customer.
This person is subscribed to changes, and allowed to view
and change the topic.
